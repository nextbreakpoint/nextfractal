NextFractal contains Java code derived from C/C++ code from applications Xaos and ContextFree.


## DESCRIPTION

NextFractal is an application for creating fractals and other algorithmically generated images. Images are generated from instructions contained in a script. NextFractal provides tools for rendering images, creating time-based and event-based animations, and exporting images and animations.

NextFractal is currently able to interpret two scripting languages: Mandelbrot and CFDG. Mandelbrot is a domain specific language for creating images of the Mandelbrot set and its variants (the Julia and Fatou sets). CFDG is a context-free grammar for creating images by an iterative process.


## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

NextFractal has been tested on OS X 14 (Intel), Windows 11, and Linux/Debian 12 and Linux/Fedora 38. NextFractal requires a machine with at least 4-cores CPU and 8Gb RAM.


## DOCUMENTATION

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/nextbreakpoint/nextfractal/wiki) for documentation. The wiki contains a tutorial for the scripting language, and examples of scripts.
